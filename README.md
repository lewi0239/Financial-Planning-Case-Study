## Financial Concerns and Goals:

Jane's Concerns: Jane is increasingly anxious about her financial future, particularly in saving for retirement and for Marry’s education. She is aware of the rising trend among Canadians of retiring later with higher debt loads and fewer savings. Jane is also somewhat skeptical of traditional financial institutions and financial advice.

John's Perspective: John has some experience with day trading but holds a critical view of the stock market, feeling it is “rigged.” He was initially hesitant about consulting a financial planner.

Primary Family Goals:

Sell John's portion of the family-owned cottage to free up capital.

Reduce their debt load.

Begin systematic saving forMarry’s post-secondary education.

Both John and Jane aim to retire by age 60.

Initial Consultation withABC Financial Planning Corps:

Jane Doe approaches ABC Financial Planning Corps in Toronto, Ontario, forprofessional financial advice. She lives with her husband, John, and their daughter, Marry. After some initial reluctance, the family meets with Elizabeth Stonks, a well-respected financial planner in the Toronto area. Elizabeth holds her CFP (Certified Financial Planner) designation, is licensed to sell life insurance, and has the Canadian Securities certification. She specializes in family retirement planning and possesses an extensive network of tax specialists, insurance agents, lawyers, and stockbrokers. Although highly skilled in retirement planning, Elizabeth’s expertise in tax planning and family trusts is less developed.

## Elizabeths Approach:

Priority: Elizabeth’s main focus is on building trust with both John and Jane, understanding their values and concerns. She acknowledges that without a committed savings plan, the family risks falling short of their financial goals.

First Steps: Elizabeth proposes an initial session to:

Sign legal documents to initiate asset transfers.

Review Marry’s educational aspirations and potential savings plans.

Discuss immediate adjustments to their financial planning structure, aligning with John and Jane’s retirement timeline and goal to reduce debt.

## Summary:

Elizabeth aims to create a balanced plan that respects John and Jane’s financial hesitancies and retirement goals while emphasizing the urgency of disciplined savings and debt reduction in a Canadian context.
